# Custom Vagrant

## About
I styled this Vagrant VM to meet my requirements.<br />
In other words, I installed tools that I normally use.<br />
Feel free to use it if you find this useful.<br />

Tools:<br />
- Java
- Maven
- Tree package (Quite useful to display the folder (directory) structure)
- Git
- Atom (Powerful text editor)
- Shutter (Linux version of Snipping tool but an improved version of it)

## How to use it

I assume you have Vagrant and VM installed already.<br />
<strong>1. Create a folder:</strong> mkdir foldername (cmd)<br />
<strong>2. Change Directory:</strong> cd foldername <br />
<strong>3. Initialise Vagrant file:</strong> vagrant init <br />
<strong>4. Customise Vagrant file:</strong> as it looks like in this repo (up to you how)<br />
<strong>5. Start Vagrant:</strong> vagrant up<br />
<strong>6. Login details:</strong> vagrant vagrant
